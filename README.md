A blog post website made in react. A boilerplate is used which you can get from
https://github.com/StephenGrider/ReduxSimpleStarter. Done with the intent to learn react
basics and understanding how it works. 

Basic functionalities, GET, POST, DELETE. no update but will try to implement maybe soon.
First knack in trying react router. Data states are all stored in redux.
